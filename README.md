## Take home messages

- The Biodiversity Distribution Index is a biodiversity indicator that is using species distribution to assess biodiversity change in the province of Quebec

- It uses the same methodology as the Living Planet Index, but it uses growthrates of species distribution instead of population growthrates

- The Biodiversity Distribution Index will be calculated for birds only (for now)

- While it can identifies gain and loss of biodiversity, it can also identifies alteration of biodiversity (e.g. migration of distribution towards the North to follow climate change) due to it's spatial dimension
